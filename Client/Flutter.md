Flutter makes it easy and fast to build beautiful mobile apps. https://flutter.io

Flutter是一个移动应用程序的软件开发工具包（SDK），用一个代码库构建高性能、高保真的iOS和Android应用程序。目标是使开发人员能够为Android和iOS提供自然的高质量的应用，在滚动行为、排版、图标等方面实现零差异。

Flutter 是 Fuchsia 的开发框架，支持导出 Android iOS 和 Fuchsia 三个平台的安装包

## 问题

```
[!] Android toolchain - develop for Android devices (Android SDK 27.0.3)
    ✗ Android license status unknown.
[!] iOS toolchain - develop for iOS devices (Xcode 9.3)
    ✗ Xcode requires additional components to be installed in order to run.
      Launch Xcode and install additional required components when prompted.
    ✗ libimobiledevice and ideviceinstaller are not installed. To install, run:
        brew install --HEAD libimobiledevice
        brew install ideviceinstaller
    ✗ ios-deploy not installed. To install:
        brew install ios-deploy
    ✗ CocoaPods not installed.
        CocoaPods is used to retrieve the iOS platform side's plugin code that responds to your plugin usage on the Dart side.
        Without resolving iOS dependencies with CocoaPods, plugins will not work on iOS.
        For more info, see https://flutter.io/platform-plugins
      To install:
        brew install cocoapods
        pod setup
